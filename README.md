# Node cycler data
Imports and pre-processes node/route data to be used in Node cycler Navigator and Planner.

Version 1.x included data from Toerisme Vlaanderen. Version 2.x has moved to Open street data for increased accuracy
and data outside Flanders.vSpecial thanks to [vmarc](https://github.com/vmarc) for helping with exporting the data from
Openstreetmaps to geojson.
